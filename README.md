# Day---15-Height-Prediction-using-DECISION-TREE-REGRESSION
I have taken a challenge to make project on every algorithm of Machine Learning. [ Day - 15 | Height Prediction using DECISION TREE REGRESSION]
"Day-15: Height Prediction using Decision Tree Regression demonstrates how to predict a personâ€™s height based on their age using a Decision Tree Regression model. In this project, we utilize Decision Tree Regression, a non-linear machine learning algorithm, to model the relationship between age and height. The decision tree approach divides the data into segments, allowing for more flexible and accurate predictions, especially in cases where the data exhibits complex patterns. The project includes data preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating the results, providing an insightful example of how decision trees can be applied to regression problems."
